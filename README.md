### Multithreading performance increases

Multithreaded w/ 100 lines from list_of_ips.txt

real	0m16.550s
user	0m1.393s
sys	    0m0.274s

Singlethreaded w/ 100 lines from list_of_ips.txt

real	1m21.563s
user	0m2.232s
sys	    0m0.383s

The multithreaded version is about 5 times as fast.
